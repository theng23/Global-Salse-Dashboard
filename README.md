## Recommendation & Insight

  - 2012 had the highest revenue (3.2M USD), but then gradually decreased in 2013 (2.6M USD) and 2014 (2.0M USD).
  - Profit fluctuates quarterly, with peaks in Q2 2012 and Q3 2013, but a decline in Q4 2014.

- Performance by market 
  - APAC, LATAM and US have the highest number of orders.
  - Central and North Asia are the most profitable, suggesting expansion potential. LATAM, APAC and US have the highest return order rates.
  
- Customer segmentation 
  - Consumer is the largest customer group (51.59%), but also has the highest return rate (51.11%).
  - Corporate and Home Office have lower but more stable order rates. \
    
- Product catalog
  - Office Supplies has the highest number of orders, but Technology has the highest profit margin (42.06%).
  - Furniture has the lowest profit margin (19.25%), need to consider adjustment strategy.
  - Staples, Eldon File Cart are best-selling products. 
- Shipping method
  - Standard Class is the most used (~7.5K orders), while Same Day and First Class are less popular.

### Recommendation
* Restore revenue growth by implementing marketing and sales campaigns in low-performing quarters.
* Expand business in Central and North Asia, because these are the two most profitable regions.
* Reduce return rates in LATAM, APAC and US by improving quality control and after-sales service.
* Focus on Corporate and Home Office customers to increase stable revenue, instead of just depending on Consumer.
* Promote sales of technology products, because they have the highest profit margin (42.06%), and optimize the strategy for Furniture.
* Improve logistics and shipping services, especially enhancing fast shipping for high-value orders.
